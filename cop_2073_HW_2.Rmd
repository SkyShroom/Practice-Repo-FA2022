# Problem 1 (20 points)

During class you completed an activity in which you practiced `git` commands and operations (such as forking a repository, cloning it using `git clone`, and uploading changes using `git push`).

In this exercise you will used **markdown** tools discussed in class.

## Part A

You must **create a table** that shows the courses you are currently enrolled in, using the following for the headers of the table:

-   Prefix: in bold letters (such as **COP**)
-   Number: in bold letters (such as **2073**)
-   Name: in italics (such as *Introduction to Data Science*)
-   Credits (such as 3)

| Prefix | Number | Name | Credits |
|:-------|:-------|:-----|:--------|
| 12     | 12     | 12   | 12      |

| Prefix | Number | Name                              | Credits |
|--------|--------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| COP    | 2073   | Intro to Data Science             | 3       |
| COP    | 3337   | Object Oriented Programming       | 3       |
| CTS    | 2375   | Cloud Infrastructure and services | 3       |
| IDS    | 1380   | FLAME                             | 3       |

## Part B

Take a screenshot of the GitHub repo you used in HW 01, add the screenshot file to the repo, and include it in this document (review how to insert a picture using markdown).

# Problem 2 (30 points)

For this problem, you are asked to create a list of **4 concepts** you have learned about so far this semester. Include the name of the course as a sub-heading (that is, using `##`), and the concepts as an unordered list. Include a link to information about *at least one* of the concepts you listed (for example a link to the Wikipedia page about that concept/topics).

*Edit this `.Rmd` file to include the solutions here.*

## Intro to Data Science

-   Github

-   R language

-   Gitbash

## Cloud Infrastructure and services 

- AWS's division of cloud services 

## https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/airbnb-optimizes-usage-and-costs-case-study/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card

## Flame

-   Phoenix Format

-   Strength and Materials

-   Calculus 2

## Object Oriented Programming

-   C++

-   code storage optimization

-   object code

# Problem 3 (25 points)

In this problem you will practice some basic R operations. Include solutions to each items by inserting a new R chunk of code (make sure you run the chunk so that the output is displayed)

(a) Create a variable called `my_name` that contains *your preferred name*.

```{r}
my_name <- "Henry Marsh"
```

(b) Create a variable called `name_length` that holds how many letters are in `my_name`.

```{r}
name_length <- "10"

nchar("Henry Marsh")
```


(c) Show which value is bigger: $e^\pi$ or $\pi^e$. (Use the correct expressions for Euler's constant $e$ and the irrational number $\pi$ in R)

```{r}
exp(pi) < pi^exp(1)
```


(d) Use the colon operator `:` to create a vector `v` of numbers from 31 to 86. Find the length of this vector using the `length()` function.

```{r}
v <- c(31:86)
length(v)
print(v)
```


(e) Use the `seq()` function to produce a range of number from -5 to 10 in 0.5 increments.

```{r}
seq(-5, 10, 0.5)
```


# Problem 4 (25 points)

(a) (10 points) Define a function `imperial_to_metric` that takes in **two arguments**: a number of feet and a number of inches. The function should return the equivalent length in meters

```{r}
imperial_to_metric <- function(ft, inch){
  (((ft*12)+inch)*0.0254)
}
```

> To convert a length `L` from feet (`ft`) and inches (`inches`) to meters (`m`), one can use the relation: `L(m) = L(ft) × 0.3048 + L(inches) × 0.0254`

(b) (5 points) Create a variable `height_in_meters` by passing your height in imperial to the `imperial_to_metric` function.

```{r}
height_in_meters <- imperial_to_metric(6,3)
print(height_in_meters)
```

(c) (5 points) Evaluate `round(3.1415)`, `factorial(12)`, `mean(1:17)`.

```{r}
round(pi, 2)
factorial(12)
mean(1:17)
```

(d) (5 points) Create an object named `die` that contains the numbers one through six. Simulate a roll of the die with `R`'s `sample()` function.

```{r}
die <- (1:6)
sample(die)
```
